ls -i sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt sample_soft.txt – Displays the inode numbers of the original file, the hard link, and the symbolic link.

sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode because hard links point to the same physical file on disk, while the symbolic link has a different inode since it only stores the file path.
